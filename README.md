# React Portfolio

## Description

[Deployed Application](https://comforting-daifuku-2d1168.netlify.app/)
This is a portfolio built using React. It is a single page application that uses React Router to navigate between pages. It uses React Bootstrap for styling and responsiveness. It also uses React Icons for the icons in the navbar. The contact form at the moment does not send an email since we do not have a back-end, but it does validate the input and display an error message if the input is invalid.  
The portfolio is deployed on Netlify. It showcases some of my projects and has a link to my downloadable resume. The navbar is responsive and collapses on smaller screens. The portfolio is also responsive and looks good on mobile devices.  
I learned a lot about React while building this portfolio. I learned about React Router, React Bootstrap, and React Icons. I also learned about how to use React to create a single page application. I struggled a little with some css styling, but I was able to figure it out. I look forward to learning more about React and using it to build more applications.
